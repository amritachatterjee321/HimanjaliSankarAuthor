# CMS Tab Close Authentication Implementation

## Overview

The CMS now automatically clears authentication tokens when the browser tab is actually closed, requiring users to re-authenticate when reopening the CMS in a new tab or browser window. Users can switch between tabs without losing their authentication.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes Made

1. **Switched from localStorage to sessionStorage**: 
   - Tokens are now stored in `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage`
   - `sessionStorage` automatically clears when the tab is closed
   - Provides better security as tokens don't persist across browser sessions

2. **Added Tab Close Event Handlers**:
   - `beforeunload`: Triggers when tab/window is about to close
   - `unload`: Triggers when page is being unloaded
   - Note: Removed `pagehide`, `visibilitychange`, and `blur` events to avoid clearing tokens when switching tabs

3. **Automatic Token Clearing**:
   - All event handlers clear the authentication token from sessionStorage
   - Sets `isAuthenticated` to false
   - Logs the action for debugging purposes

### Code Location

The implementation is in `public/cms/js/cms.js`:

```javascript
setupTabCloseHandlers() {
    // Clear token only when tab/window is actually closed
    const clearTokenOnClose = () => {
        console.log('üîê Tab/window closing, clearing authentication token');
        sessionStorage.removeItem('cms_token');
        this.isAuthenticated = false;
    };

    // Handle beforeunload event (when tab/window is about to close)
    window.addEventListener('beforeunload', clearTokenOnClose);

    // Handle unload event (when page is being unloaded)
    window.addEventListener('unload', clearTokenOnClose);

    // Note: Removed pagehide, visibilitychange, and blur events
    // to avoid clearing token when switching tabs or losing focus
}
```

### User Experience

1. **Login**: User logs into CMS normally
2. **Active Session**: User can work in CMS while tab is active
3. **Tab Switching**: User can switch to other tabs without losing authentication
4. **Tab Close**: When user closes the tab completely, token is automatically cleared
5. **Re-authentication**: When user reopens CMS in a new tab, they must login again

### Security Benefits

- **Session Isolation**: Each tab session is independent
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual logout required
- **Reduced Risk**: Tokens don't persist across browser sessions
- **Immediate Effect**: Token clearing happens instantly when tab becomes inactive

### Testing

A test file `test-tab-close-auth.html` has been created to demonstrate the functionality:

1. Open the test page
2. Click "Login" to simulate authentication
3. Switch to another tab - token should remain valid
4. Come back to the test tab - authentication should still be active
5. Close the tab completely
6. Reopen the test page in a new tab
7. Notice that authentication is required again

### Browser Compatibility

This implementation works across all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Notes

- Only `beforeunload` and `unload` events are used to clear tokens on actual tab closure
- Removed `pagehide`, `visibilitychange`, and `blur` events to allow tab switching without losing authentication
- All token operations use `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage`
- Console logging is included for debugging purposes
- The implementation is non-intrusive and doesn't affect normal CMS functionality
